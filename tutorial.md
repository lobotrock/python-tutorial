# Running Python Interactively

The `python` command starts the python interpreter.

```
bash$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Oct 11 2016, 05:24:00)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.38)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("hello world")
hello world
>>>
```

# Running a Python Script

This is a simple python script, which we'll save as tut1.py:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
print("hello world")
```

--

Make the script executable:

```
bash$ chmod +x tut1.py
bash$
```

--

Run the script from the command prompt:

```
bash$ ./tut1.py
hello world
bash$
```

# Done!

You have now completed the tutorial mission.
