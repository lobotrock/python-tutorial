# Sherman's 60 Minute Python Tutorial

[View the Slide Show (https://mnebuerquo.github.io/python-tutorial/)](https://mnebuerquo.github.io/python-tutorial/)

## Audience

This is a short intro to python, prepared for Deep Mind, the machine learning 
study group at Kroger Digital.

This tutorial is intended for programmers who already know another language,
and want an introduction to python. I assume at least some background knowledge 
in the audience, and that they have python installed somewhere.
